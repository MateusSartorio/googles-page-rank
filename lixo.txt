Amos and Ann had a poem to learn
A poem to learn one day
But alas they sighed and alack they cried
Twere better to go and play
Ann was sure twas a waste of time
To bother a child with jingling rhyme
Amos said Whats the sense in rhythm
Feet and lines He had finished with em
They peered at the poem with scowly faces
And yawned and stumbled and lost their places
Thena breeze romped by and a bluebird sang
And they shut the book with a snap and a bang
Shut the book and were off and away
Away on flying feet
Never did squirrels move more light
Or rabbits run more fleet
Over a wall and down a lane
And through a field they ran
And Where shall we go said Amos Oh

ma fortune mais aussi mon bonheur puisque dans ma jeunesse comme a

prete souvent pour moi du charme a la solitude Je vis encore alors avec
ceux qui ne sont plus et je dois remercier la Providence qui ma laisse

jouissances que javais dans la maison maternelle je vous dirai que mon

PREFACE
This Volume offers to the reader a short and condensed account of the
origin growth and condition of the Church in all parts of the world
from the time of our Lord down to the end of the fifteenth century the
narrative being compressed into as small a compass as is consistent
with a readable form
In such a work the reader will not of course expect to find any full
and detailed account of so vast a subject as PreReformation Church
History  Its object is rather to sketch out the historical truth about
each Church and to indicate the general principles on which further
inquiry may be conducted by those who have the opportunity of making it
It is hoped that those whose circumstances do not admit of an extended
study of the subject will find in the following pages a clear though
condensed view of the periods and Churches treated of and that those
whose reading is of a less limited range will be put in possession of
certain definite lines of thought by which they may be guided in
reading the statements of more elaborate histories
It may be added that the writers standpoint throughout has been that
of a loyal attachment to the Church of England as the authorized
exponent and upholder of Catholic doctrine for English people

CHAPTER I
The foundation of the Church among the Jews
AD 33AD 38
Before entering upon an account of the Foundation and AfterHistory of
Popular Education embracing such considerations as shall have a
tendency to arouse the popular mind to a due appreciation of the
importancein a political social moral and religious point of
viewof securing to every child in all our borders a good common school
education together with such instructions to citizens and teachers as
shall constitute a directory to the highest improvement of which our
primary schools are susceptible is a desideratum therefore
Resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of Michigan
That the Hon IRA MAYHEW the present Superintendent of Public
Instruction in this state be requested to prepare for publication in
book form the various matters set forth in his public Lectures
delivered by request of the Legislature in the Hall of the House
during the present session together with such other matter as in his
judgment would tend to the further improvement of our system of public
instruction to the end that the necessary information in regard to this
subject may be diffused throughout the state and nation
A Preamble and Resolution similar to the preceding were likewise
adopted by the Senate
PREFACE
Who is sufficient for these things is a question which any one may well
ask when sitting down to the preparation of a treatise on popular
education The author of this work would have shrunk from the
undertaking but from deference to the judgment of the honorable body
that unanimously invited its preparation He has also been encouraged
not a little by many kind friends one of whom distinguished for his
labors in the department of public instruction writing from New
England says I rejoice at your good beginnings at the West You have
a noble and inspiring field of action No pentup Utica contracts your
powers I beseech you fail not to fill it with your glorious
educational truth though you should pour out your spirit and your life
to do so
The duties required by law of the Superintendent of Public Instruction
in the State of Michigan are comparatively few The author however
five years ago and soon after entering upon the discharge of those
duties undertook voluntary labors for the purpose of awakening a
deeper interest with all classes of the community in behalf of common
schools and of inspiring confidence in their redeeming power when
improved as they may be constituting as they do the only reliable
instrumentality for the proper training of the rising generation These
labors which were hailed as promising great usefulness and which were
prosecuted in every county of the state were every where received with
unexpected favor and constitute the foundation of the present volume
Many of the subjects then discussed are here greatly amplified
Among the lectures referred to in the resolution under which this work
has been undertaken was one on the Michigan School System But as the
Convention for the revision of the Constitution of this state is now in
session it has been deemed advisable to omit in this connection the
extensive consideration of the details of that system This may
constitute the theme of a small manual which shall hereafter appear
In the present volume the author has endeavored so to present the

CHAPTER I
THE DOCTORS DAUGHTER
It was a beautiful summer morning when slowly I wheeled my way along
the principal street of the village of Walford A little valise was
strapped in front of my bicycle my coat rolled into a small compass
was securely tied under the seat and I was starting out to spend my
vacation
I was the teacher of the village school which useful institution had
been closed for the season the day before much to the gratification
of pedagogue and scholars This position was not at all the summit of
my youthful ambition In fact I had been very much disappointed when
Who own the ample sea
Or brooches when the Emperor
With rubies pelteth me
Or gold who am the Prince of Mines
Or diamonds when I see
A diadem to fit a dome
Continual crowning me

SUPERIORITY TO FATE
Superiority to fate
Is difficult to learn
T is not conferred by any
But possible to earn
A pittance at a time
Until to her surprise
The soul with strict economy
Subsists till Paradise
III
HOPE
Hope is a subtle glutton
He feeds upon the fair
And yet inspected closely
What abstinence is there
His is the halcyon table
That never seats but one
And whatsoever is consumed
The same amounts remain

Forbidden fruit a flavor has
That lawful orchards mocks
How luscious lies the pea within
The pod that Duty locks

Heaven is what I cannot reach
The apple on the tree
Provided it do hopeless hang
That heaven is to me
The color on the cruising cloud
The interdicted ground
Behind the hill the house behind
There Paradise is found

A WORD
A word is dead
When it is said
Some say
a growing or perhaps one should say an established conviction that the
pupils enjoyment of what he reads ought to be the chief consideration
in the work From such enjoyment it is conceded come the knowledge and
the power that are the end of study All profitable literature work in
the secondary grades must be based upon the unforced attention and
activity of the student
An inevitable phase of this liberal attitude is a readiness to promote
the study of modern authors It is now the generally accepted view that
many pieces of recent literature are more suitable for young peoples
reading than the old and conventionally approved classics This is not
to say that the really readable classics should be discarded since they
have their own place and their own value Yet it is everywhere admitted
that modern literature should be given its opportunity to appeal to high
school students and that at some stage in their course it should
receive its due share of recognition The mere fact that modern writers
are in point of material and style less remote than the classic
authors from the immediate interests of the students is sufficient to
recommend them Then too since young people are in the nature of
things constantly brought into contact with some form of modern
literature they need to be provided with a standard of criticism and
choice
The present volume is an attempt to assemble in a convenient manner a
number of selections from recent literature such as high school
students of average taste and ability may understand and enjoy These
selections are not all equally difficult Some need to be read rapidly
for their intrinsic interest others deserve more analysis of form and
content still others demand careful intensive study This diversity of
method is almost a necessity in a full years course in reading in
which rigidity and monotony ought above all things to be avoided
Although convinced that the larger part of the reading work in the high
school years should be devoted to the study of prose the editor has
here included what she believes to be a just proportion of poetry The
poems have been chosen with a view to the fact that they are varied in
form and sentiment and that they exhibit in no small degree the
tendencies of modern poetic thought with its love of nature and its
humanitarian impulses
An attempt has been made to present examples of the most usual and
readable forms of prose compositionnarration the account of travel
the personal essay and serious exposition The authors of these
selections possess without exception that distinction of style which
entitles them to a high rank in literature and makes them inspiring
models for the unskilled writer
A word may be said as to the intention of the study helps and lists of
readings The object of this equipment is to conserve the energies of
the teacher and direct the activities of the student It is by no means
expected that any one class will be able to make use of all the material
provided yet it is hoped that a considerable amount may prove
available to every group that has access to the text
The study questions serve to concentrate the reading of the students in
order to prevent that aimless wandering of eye and mind which with many

WHAT IS A PLAY
A play is a story devised to be presented by actors on a stage before an
audience
This plain statement of fact affords an exceedingly simple definition of
the dramaa definition so simple indeed as to seem at the first glance
easily obvious and therefore scarcely worthy of expression But if we

I PAUL CEZANNE
After prolonged study of the art shown at the Paris Autumn Salon you
ask yourself This whirlpool of jostling ambitions crazy colours
still crazier drawing and compositionwhither does it tend Is there
any strain of tendency any central current to be detected Is it
young genius in the raw awaiting the sunshine of success to ripen its
somewhat terrifying gifts Or is the exhibition a huge mystifying
blague What you ask as you apply wet compresses to your weary
eyeballs blistered by dangerous proximity to so many blazing
canvases does the Autumn Salon mean to French art
There are many canvases the subjects of which are more pathologic than
artistic subjects only fit for the confessional or the privacy of the
clinic But apart from these disagreeable episodes the main note of
the Salon is a riotous energy the noisy ebullition of a gang of
students let loose in the halls of art They seem to rush by you
yelling from sheer delight in their lung power and if you are rudely
controlling influence upon events of naval power even when
transferred to an inland body of fresh water The lesson there
however was the same as in the larger fields of war heretofore
treated Not by rambling operations or naval duels are wars decided
but by force massed and handled in skilful combination It matters
not that the particular force be small The art of war is the same
throughout and may be illustrated as really though less
conspicuously by a flotilla as by an armada by a corporals guard
or the three units of the Horatii as by a host of a hundred
thousand
The interest of the War of 1812 to Americans has commonly been felt
to lie in the brilliant evidence of high professional tone and
efficiency reached by their navy as shown by the singleship actions
and by the two decisive victories achieved by little squadrons upon
the lakes Without in the least overlooking the permanent value of
such examples and such traditions to the nation and to the military
service which they illustrate it nevertheless appears to the writer
that the effect may be even harmful to the people at large if it be
permitted to conceal the deeply mortifying condition to which the
country was reduced by parsimony in preparation or to obscure the
lessons thence to be drawn for practical application now It is
perhaps useless to quarrel with the tendency of mankind to turn its
eyes from disagreeable subjects and to dwell complacently upon those
which minister to selfcontent We mostly read the newspapers in which
we find our views reflected and dispense ourselves easily with the
less pleasing occupation of seeing them roughly disputed but a writer
on a subject of national importance may not thus exempt himself from
the unpleasant features of his task
The author has thought it also essential to precede his work by a
somewhat full exposition of the train of causes which through a long
series of years led to the war It may seem at first farfetched to go
back to 1651 for the origins of the War of 1812 but without such
preliminary consideration it is impossible to understand or to make
due allowance for the course of Great Britain It will be found
however that the treatment of the earlier period is brief and only
sufficient for a clear comprehension of the five years of intense
international strain preceding the final rupture years the full
narrative of which is indispensable to appreciating the grounds and
development of the quarrelto realize what they fought each other
for
That much of Great Britains action was unjustifiable and at times
even monstrous regarded in itself alone must be admitted but we
shall ill comprehend the necessity of preparation for war if we
neglect to note the pressure of emergency of deadly peril upon a
state or if we fail to recognize that traditional habits of thought
constitute with nations as with individuals a compulsive moral force
which an opponent can control only by the display of adequate physical
power Such to the British people was the conviction of their right
and need to compel the service of their native seamen wherever found
on the high seas The conclusion of the writer is that at a very
the Oro  It seemed to hold in its motionless bosom the very spirit of
silence and death  The delicately traced pattern of a rabbit or weasel
track and a narrow human pathway that wound tortuously into the
sepulchral depths were the only signs of life in all the white
stillness  Away down the dim cathedrallike aisles that fainted into
softest grey in the distance the crackling of an overburdened twig
rang startlingly clear in the awesome hush  The tall firs and pines
swept the white earth with their snowladen branches the drooping
limbs looking like throngs of cowled heads bent to worship in the
sacred stillness of a vast temple  For the forest was indeed a place
in which to wonder and to pray a place all white and holy filled with
the mystery and awe of death
But suddenly into this softly curtained sanctuary came a profaning
sound a clear joyous shout rang through the sacred aisles and down
the narrow pathway leaping over fallen logs whipping aside the laden
branches and scattering their snowcrowns in a whirling mist about him
destroying in his ruthless progress both the sanctity and the beauty
of the place came a human figure a little figure straight and
sturdy and as lithe and active as any other wild forestcreature
His small redmittened hands the scarlet woollen scarf about his
neck and his rosy cheeks made a bold dash of colour in the sombre
gloom as his abounding life disturbed the winter deathsleep
On he came leaping from log to log like a hare and setting the
stately forest arches ringing to a rollicking Scottish song tuneful
and incongruous
Wi a hundred pipers an a an a
Wi a hundred pipers an a an a
Well up an gie them a blaw a blaw
Wi a hundred pipers an a an a
But as he plunged down the hill into the grey depths he suddenly ceased
singing  The awe of the place touched his childs spirit  Reared in
the forest though he had been he suddenly felt strangely unfamiliar
with his surroundings  He had never before experienced anything like
fear in the woods  The rigours of seven Canadian winters had bred a
hardy spirit in this little backwoodsman and besides what was there to
dread in the forest  It had been his playground ever since he was
first able to steal away from Granny and toddle off to the bush to
gather blue flags and poke up the goggleeyed frogs from their fragrant
muskpools  But here was something unfamiliar a strange uncanny place
the swamp seemed today and being Natures intimate he fell into
sudden sympathy with her awestricken mood
He sped silently forward glancing fearfully down the dim shadowy
aisles so ghostly so mysterious dreading he knew not what
Eh eh it will be a fearsome place he whispered  Its jisteh
it must be the valley of the shadow  And then he suddenly
remembered the psalm that Granny had taught him as soon as he could
speak
Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil for Thou art with me
He whispered it over from beginning to end not because he comprehended
consisted mainly in arranging the materials leaving the writer to
tell his own story as much as possible in his own way and in his own
words

there is no such thing as teasing the poor man Ive been in the house
for six months and Ive never heard him say anything but yes no
do this very well retire You would think these are the only
words he knows Ask M Casimir if Im not right
Our guvnor isnt very gay thats a fact responded the valet
The footman was listening with a serious air as if greatly interested
in the character of the people whom he was to serve And mademoiselle
he asked what does she say to such an existence
Bless me during the six months she has been here she has never once
complained
If she is bored added M Casimir she conceals it bravely
Naturally enough sneered the waitingmaid with an ironical gesture
each month that mademoiselle remains here brings her too much money
for her to complain
By the laugh that greeted this reply and by the looks the older
servants exchanged the newcomer must have realized that he had
discovered the secret skeleton hidden in every house What what he
exclaimed on fire with curiosity is there really anything in that To
tell the truth I was inclined to doubt it
His companions were evidently about to tell him all they knew or rather
all they thought they knew when the frontdoor bell rang vigorously
There he comes exclaimed the concierge but hes in too much of a
hurry hell have to wait awhile
He sullenly pulled the cord however the heavy door swayed on its
hinges and a cabdriver breathless and hatless burst into the room
crying Help help
The servants sprang to their feet
Make haste continued the driver I was bringing a gentleman
hereyou must know him Hes outside in my vehicle
Without pausing to listen any longer the servants rushed out and the
drivers incoherent explanation at once became intelligible At the
bottom of the cab a roomy fourwheeler a man was lying all of a heap
speechless and motionless He must have fallen forward face downward
and owing to the jolting of the vehicle his head had slipped under the
front seat
Poor devil muttered M Casimir he must have had a stroke of
apoplexy The valet was peering into the vehicle as he spoke and his
comrades were approaching when suddenly he drew back uttering a cry of

recognised he added the central stone cupola of the National Gallery
appearing over all like a hastily bestowed blessing but covered the
remaining space upon his canvas with imaginary stalls of glowing
flowers and even more imaginary flowersellers  His picture was
greatly admired and very much resembled the Market Square in Havre
upon a Monday morning
A Spanish artist chancing to pass the same way likewise hastily
completed a picture of Trafalgar Square as he wished to see it adding
by way of a decorative effect a latticework of trellised vines like
unto his beloved vineyards of Andalusia  Dwarf oranges grew in
profusion and hung their coloured golden globes over the squat stone
walls  A brilliant Southern sun beat upon both baking the walls
redhot and ripening the oranges at one and the same time  This
picture the artist named Trafalgar Square when the Sun Shines
A Cubist painter not to be outdone with regard to his point of view of
such a subject covered an immense canvas with wonderful heaving
squares of ochre and green viewed from a background suggesting endless
mud  This suggestion however may have been in the nature of a small
tribute to the usual condition of the London streets  This production
which the Cubist artist was optimistic enough to name simply Trafalgar
Square was instantly bought by a famous geologist who to this day
indulges in the beautiful belief that he possesses the only indication
of what this particular portion of the world was like before ever the
earth was made
Last of all arrived a Futurist painter who painted everything in
Trafalgar Square and nothing that did not appear in it  The
painter however selected a really wonderful aspect of the Square
seen from a most strange angle a sort of birdseye view of it which
could only have been obtained from a balloon  So remarkable was the
perspective that the entire Square as seen in the picture appeared as
if it were being gradually drawn sideways up to Heaven  The great
Nelson column and all the four lions could be viewed simultaneously
and the artist had painted all the four lions alike
Now a Writer whose chambers overlooked Trafalgar Square and who was
acquainted with its every aspect by night as well as day knew full
well that the Futurist artist was wrong when he painted all the four
lions alike  The Writer knew that one Lion was totally different
from all the others so the Writer smiled and kept his own counsel
I will wait said the Writer until somebody else has made the same
discovery that I have made  I will remain completely silent concerning
one square patch of fairyland placed within the very hub and centre of
the Universe within the busiest part of a great city  When some other
traveller finds the key to the mystic place we shall both discover it
is possible to talk about something which nobody else understands and
be enabled to compare notes

once roamed in his insatiate pursuit of savages and renegades and
who was purely a product of the times Civilization could not have
brought forth a man like Wetzel Great revolutions great crises
great moments come and produce the men to deal with them
The border needed Wetzel The settlers would have needed many more
years in which to make permanent homes had it not been for him He
was never a pioneer but always a hunter after Indians When not on
the track of the savage foe he was in the settlement with his keen
eye and ear ever alert for signs of the enemy To the superstitious
Indians he was a shadow a spirit of the border which breathed
menace from the dark forests To the settlers he was the right arm
of defense a fitting leader for those few implacable and unerring
frontiersmen who made the settlement of the West a possibility
And if this story of one of his relentless pursuits shows the man as
he truly was loved by pioneers respected and feared by redmen and
hated by renegades if it softens a little the ruthless name history
accords him the writer will have been well repaid

The Spirit of the Border
Chapter I
Nell Im growing powerful fond of you
So you must be Master Joe if often telling makes it true
The girl spoke simply and with an absence of that roguishness which
was characteristic of her Playful words arch smiles and a touch
of coquetry had seemed natural to Nell but now her grave tone and
her almost wistful glance disconcerted Joe
During all the long journey over the mountains she had been gay and
bright while now when they were about to part perhaps never to
meet again she showed him the deeper and more earnest side of her
character It checked his boldness as nothing else had done
Suddenly there came to him the real meaning of a womans love when
she bestows it without reservation Silenced by the thought that he
had not understood her at all and the knowledge that he had been
half in sport he gazed out over the wild country before them
The scene impressed its quietness upon the young couple and brought
more forcibly to their minds the fact that they were at the gateway
of the unknown West that somewhere beyond this rude frontier
settlement out there in those unbroken forests stretching dark and
silent before them was to be their future home
From the high bank where they stood the land sloped and narrowed
gradually until it ended in a sharp point which marked the last bit
of land between the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers Here these
swift streams merged and formed the broad Ohio The newborn river
even here at its beginning proud and swelling as if already certain
of its faraway grandeur swept majestically round a wide curve and
apparently lost itself in the forest foliage
On the narrow point of land commanding a view of the rivers stood a
long low structure enclosed by a stockade fence on the four
corners of which were little boxshaped houses that bulged out as if
trying to see what was going on beneath The massive timbers used in
in his dunnage and took a small suite of chambers over the ancient
gate of Cliffords Inn Now it would be easy enough and the temptation
is great to convey the impression that the writer had arrived in the
Metropolis to make his name and win fame and fortune with his
manuscript So runs the tale in many a novel issued during the last
twentyfive years It is time therefore to invent something new The
penniless lawstudent who writes a best seller and wins the love of a
celebrated actress must make way for a seagoing engineer with a
years wages and a volume of essays in his pocket and who had not
succeeded in winning the love of anybody Indeed the singular
moderation of the demands of this young man will be appreciated by
any one who has been afflicted with ambition for he has never at
any time desired either to write a play edit a magazine or marry a
primadonna At the particular juncture when he took over the little
suite of furnished chambers from a young newspaper man who had
received a sudden invitation to visit a rich uncle his principal
preoccupation was to pass his examination for his certificate
of competency as a firstclass engineer To this end he began a
mysterious existence possible only to the skilled Londoner For the
benefit of those who are not skilled Londoners the following
description may evoke interest
In the morning on waking he saw through the small bowed window which
looked out into the Inn the sunlight shining upon the gilded gothic
roof of the Rolls Building and possibly touching the tops of the trees
of the grimy enclosure Stepping through into the front room he could
lean out of a mullioned affair below which he could read the date
carved in the stone1472and looking up a long narrow court he could
watch the morning traffic of the Strand passing the farther end like
the film of a cinematograph Down below a gentleman who sold studs
shoelaces and dying pigs on the curb and who kept his stock in a
cupboard under the arch was preparing to start out for the day A
dying pig it may be mentioned was a toy much in demand among
stockbroking clerks and other frivolous young gentlemen in the City
and consisted of a bladder shaped like a pig whose snout contained a
whistle which gave out on deflation an almost human note of anguish
Should the hour be before eight which was probable since the author
had contracted the habit at sea of rising at four he would be
further exhilarated by seeing his landlord Mr Honeyball in a
tightly buttoned frockcoat and wideawake hat march with an erect
and military air to the end of the passage dart a piercing glance in
either direction and remain hands behind back and shoulders squared
taking the air Which meant that Mrs Honeyball was engaged in the
dark and dungeonlike kitchen below the worn flags of the archway
preparing the coffee and bacon for Mr Honeyballs breakfast
Having washed and shavedand here it may be set down for the benefit
of Americans and others not skilled in metropolitan existence that
when a building bears over its archway the date 1472 the bathing
arrangements within will not be of the most modern designthe author
then took his pipe tobacco and cane and prepared to descend the
winding stone stairway which ended in a door of heavy wood This

Illustration LATEST PORTRAIT OF WILLIAM II OF GERMANY
EMPEROR WILLIAM II OF GERMANY
Since William II of Germany ascended the throne as German Emperor and
King of Prussia on June 15 1888 the eyes of Europe have been fixed
on him He has always been rather an unknown quantity and he is
regarded by the powers as an enfant terrible The press of the world
delights in showing up his weak points and the war lord undoubtedly
has them but at the same time he has qualities which are to be
admired and which make him conspicuous among the rulers of Europe
He is popular in Germany and it is not surprising for in spite of
being autocratic to the last degree he is honest courageous
ambitious hard working and withal a thorough German being
intensely patriotic Indeed if the people of the Fatherland had the
right to vote for a sovereign they would undoubtedly choose the
present constitutional ruler for while the virtues we have named may
seem commonplace they are not so when embodied in an emperor One
thing which places William at a disadvantage is his excessive
frankness which is in him almost a fault for if he couched his
utterances in courtly or diplomatic phrases they would pass
unchallenged instead of being cited to ridicule him His mistakes
have largely resulted from his impulsive nature coupled with
chauvinism which is perhaps justifiable or at least excusable
in a ruler
Since the time when William was a child he evidenced a strong desire
to become acquainted with the details of the office to which his lofty
birth entitled him It is doubtful if any king since the time of
Frederick the Great has studied the routine of the public offices and
Den geheelen dag was het voortdurend klingelingeling en dat
hield niet op voordat s avonds laat de winkeldeur op het nachtslot
werd gedaan
De oude man beefde soms over al zijn leden van vermoeidheid als hij
eindelijk in zijn bed gestapt was en van overspanning kon hij dan
dikwijls in geen uren den slaap nog vatten Eindelijk begrepen Moeder
Griet en Dik beiden dat het zoo niet langer gingdat er verandering
moest komen
En die verandering kwam
Het huisje naast den winkel kwam te huur t Was een allerliefst
huisje wel klein maar keurig net t Was een huisje voor een paar
oude menschen die rustig hun ouden dag wilden doorbrengen
Zoodra Dik hoorde dat het te huur was zei hij op een avond toen
de winkel op het nachtslot was
Hoor eens Vader en Moeder weet u dat het huisje hiernaast te
huur komt
Is t waar vroeg moeder Trom Neen dat weet ik niet
Trom zei niets Hij keek Dik aan en streek met zijn hand langs zijn
dunne bakkebaardjes
Ja zei Dikt is zoo en nu had ik gedacht dat het juist een
huisje voor u beiden zou zijn
Ja zei Trom dat denk ik ook en dat doe ik
t Is een lief huis ging Dik voort Niet te groot en erg
gemakkelijk in t bewonen En als u mij dan den winkel verhuurde
zou u een rustigen ouden dag kunnen hebben t Wordt Vader toch wel
wat erg zwaar in den winkel
Ja dat doet heten dat doet het zei Trom
En wou jij dan alleen in den winkel gaan wonen Dik vroeg vrouw
Trom met een glimlachje
Dik lachte ook
Neen Moeder dat is nu juist mijne bedoeling niet Als u en Vader het
goedvinden zou ik wel willen trouwen Anneke en ik hebben elkander
al gekend van onze vroegste kinderjaren af en wij houden veel van
mekaar Duswat dunkt u er van
Moeder Trom stond op sloeg haar armen om Diks hals gaf hem een
kus op elke wang en zei
Mijn zegen er op Dik
Trom trok zoo hard aan zijn bakkebaardjes dat hij er de vlassige
haartjes van in de hand hield en zei
Ja ja zoo is het goed en dat is het Griet onze Dik is toch een
bizonder kinden dat isie
Tweede Hoofdstuk
De belangrijkste dag uit het leven van Dik Trom
Het ging al gauw als een loopend vuurtje door het dorp Dik Trom
gaat trouwen met Anneke en zijn ouders gaan het huisje bewonen naast
den winkel En alle menschen vonden het erg best t Was net een
spannetje dat bij elkaar hoorde zei men Allebei zijn ze vroolijk
allebei jong allebei dik en dat was waar want Anneke evenaarde in
gezetheid haar aanstaanden man Zij zag er door en door gezond uit
had een paar blozende wangen en keek iedereen altoos vroolijk en
Aristotle has none of the high enthusiasm or poetic imagination of
Plato He is even unduly impatient of Platos idealism as is shown
by the criticisms in the second book But he has a power to see the
possibilities of good in things that are imperfect and the patience of
the true politician who has learned that if he would make men what
they ought to be he must take them as he finds them His ideal
is constructed not of pure reason or poetry but from careful and
sympathetic study of a wide range of facts His criticism of Plato in
the light of history in Book II chap v though as a criticism it is
curiously inept reveals his own attitude admirably Let us remember
that we should not disregard the experience of ages in the multitude
of years these things if they were good would certainly not have been
unknown for almost everything has been found out although sometimes
they are not put together in other cases men do not use the knowledge
which they have Aristotle in his Constitutions had made a study of one
hundred and fiftyeight constitutions of the states of his day and the
fruits of that study are seen in the continual reference to concrete
political experience which makes the Politics in some respects a
critical history of the workings of the institutions of the Greek city
state In Books IV V and VI the ideal state seems far away and
we find a dispassionate survey of imperfect states the best ways of
preserving them and an analysis of the causes of their instability
It is as though Aristotle were saying I have shown you the proper and
normal type of constitution but if you will not have it and insist on
living under a perverted form you may as well know how to make the best
of it In this way the Politics though it defines the state in the
light of its ideal discusses states and institutions as they are
Ostensibly it is merely a continuation of the Ethics but it comes to
treat political questions from a purely political standpoint
This combination of idealism and respect for the teachings of experience
constitutes in some ways the strength and value of the Politics but it
also makes it harder to follow The large nation states to which we are
accustomed make it difficult for us to think that the state could be
constructed and modelled to express the good life We can appreciate
Aristotles critical analysis of constitutions but find it hard to take
seriously his advice to the legislator Moreover the idealism and the
empiricism of the Politics are never really reconciled by Aristotle
himself
It may help to an understanding of the Politics if something is said on
those two points
We are accustomed since the growth of the historical method to the
belief that states are not made but grow and are apt to be impatient
with the belief which Aristotle and Plato show in the powers of the
lawgiver But however true the maxim may be of the modern nation state
it was not true of the much smaller and more selfconscious Greek city
When Aristotle talks of the legislator he is not talking in the
air Students of the Academy had been actually called on to give new
constitutions to Greek states For the Greeks the constitution was not
merely as it is so often with us a matter of political machinery It
was regarded as a way of life Further the constitution within the
Henry go out to the fields the woman said
No Henry said standing stretching his thin hard body I wont go
out to the fields Neither will August Brown nor Clyde Briggs nor Alfred
Swanson None of us Anywhere Not until the foods been stopped long
enough for people to wake up
The farmer looked out of the kitchen window beyond his tractor and the
cow barn and the windmill He looked at rows of strong corn shivering
their soft silk in the morning breeze Well stop the corn Stop the
wheat Stop the cattle the hogs the chickens
You cant
I cant But all of us together can
No sense the woman said wagging her head No sense
Its sense all right Best sense weve ever had Cant use an army
with no stomach Old as the earth Cant fight without food Takes food
to run a war
Youll starve the two of us thats all youll do Nobody else will
stop work
The farmer turned to his wife Yes they will Everywhere a farmer is
the same He works the land He reads the papers He votes He listens
to the radio He watches the television Mostly he works the land
Alone with his own thoughts and ideas He isnt any different in Maine
than he is in Oregon Weve all stopped work Now This morning
How about those across the ocean Are they stopping too Theyre not
going to feed up their soldiers To kill us if we dont starve first
To
They stopped too A farmer is a farmer Like a leaf on a tree No
matter on what tree in what country on whose land A leaf is a leaf A
farmers the same A farmer is a farmer
It wont work the woman said dully
Yes it will
Theyll make you work
How Its our own property
Theyll take it away from you
Wholl work it then
The woman rocked in her chair her mouth quivering Theyll get
somebody
The farmer shook his head Too many people doing other things like
making shells and guns like sitting in foxholes or flying planes
The woman sat rocking her hands together in her lap It wont work
she repeated
Itll work said the farmer Right now itll work Yes weve got
milkers and shuckers and weve got hatchers for the chickens Weve got
tractors and combines and threshing machines Theyre all mechanical
all right But we dont have mechanical farmers yet The pumps the
tractors the milkers dont work by themselves In time maybe Not now
Were still ahead of them on that Itll work
Go out to the fields Henry his wife said her voice like the sound
of a worn phonograph record
No the farmer said taking a pipe from his overalls I think
instead Ill just sit in the sun and watch the corn Watch the birds on

ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF FORM AND ORNAMENT
IN CERAMIC ART
BY WILLIAM H HOLMES
INTRODUCTORY
For the investigation of art in its early stages and in its widest
sensethere is probably no fairer field than that afforded by
aboriginal America ancient and modern
At the period of discovery art at a number of places on the American
continent seems to have been developing surely and steadily through the
force of the innate genius of the race and the more advanced nations
were already approaching the threshold of civilization at the same time
their methods were characterized by great simplicity and their art
products are as a consequence exceptionally homogeneous
The advent of European civilization checked the current of growth and
new and conflicting elements were introduced necessarily disastrous to
the native development
There is much however in the art of living tribes especially of those
least influenced by the whites capable of throwing light upon the
obscure passages of precolumbian art By supplementing the study of the
prehistoric by that of historic art which is still in many cases in its
incipient stages we may hope to penetrate deeply into the secrets of
the past
The advantages of this field as compared with Greece Egypt and the
Orient will be apparent when we remember that the dawn of art in these
countries lies hidden in the shadow of unnumbered ages while ours
stands out in the light of the very present This is well illustrated by
a remark of Birch who in dwelling upon the antiquity of the fictile
art says that the existence of earthen vessels in Egypt was at least
coeval with the formation of a written language1 Beyond this there
is acknowledged chaos In strong contrast with this is the fact that
all precolumbian American pottery precedes the acquisition of written
language and this contrast is emphasized by the additional fact that it

The material presented in the following notes is derived chiefly from
the native ceramic art of the United States but the principles involved
are applicable to all times and to all art as they are based upon the
laws of nature
Ceramic art presents two classes of phenomena of importance in the study
of the evolution of sthetic culture These relate first to form
and second to ornament
Form as embodied in clay vessels embraces 1st useful shapes
which may or may not be ornamental and 2d sthetic shapes which
are ornamental and may be useful There are also grotesque and

CHAPTER I
A SEMPER FIDELIS LUNCHEON
The skies must smile and the sun must shine
When Semper Fidelis goes out to dine
sang Arline Thayer joyously as she rearranged her sofa pillows for the
eighth time patting each one energetically before placing it then
stepping back to view the effect Arent you glad every ones here and
things have begun to happen again Ruth she asked blithely I hope no
one disappoints us I wish this room were larger Still it held
eighteen girls one night last year Dont you remember my Halloween
party and what a time we had squeezing in here
It is so good in Mrs Kane to let us have the dining room with Mary to
serve the oysters said Ruth We never could do things properly up
here
I know it Oysters are such slippery old things even on the half
shell returned Arline who was not specially fond of them Let me
see The girls will be here at four oclock We are to have oysters
soup a meat course salad and dessert That makes five different
courses in five different houses It will be eight oclock before we
reach the dessert I am glad that is to be served in Graces room We
always have a good time at Wayne Hall
To the readers of Grace Harlowes First Year at Overton
College Grace Harlowes Second Year at Overton College
and Grace Harlowes Third Year at Overton College Grace
Harlowe and her various intimate associates have become familiar
figures Those who made her acquaintance together with that of her
three friends Nora OMalley Jessica Bright and Anne Pierson during
her high school days will recall with pleasure the many eventful
happenings of these four happy years as set forth in Grace
Harlowes Plebe Year at High School Grace Harlowes
Sophomore Year at High School Grace Harlowes Junior Year at
High School and Grace Harlowes Senior Year at High
School
The September following the graduation of the four friends from high
school had seen their paths diverge widely for Nora and Jessica had
entered an eastern conservatory of music while Anne and Grace after
due deliberation had decided upon Overton College Miriam Nesbit of
Oakdale fame had entered college with them and the trio of friends had
spent three eventful years at Overton
It is time we gathered home grumbled Arline I have hardly seen
business intent upon the main object of the enterprise and but little
versed in science or curious about matters not immediately bearing upon
their interest and as they were written often in moments of fatigue
or hurry amid the inconveniences of wild encampments they were
often meagre in their details furnishing hints to provoke rather
than narratives to satisfy inquiry I have therefore availed myself
occasionally of collateral lights supplied by the published journals of
other travellers who have visited the scenes described such as Messrs
Lewis and Clarke Bradbury Breckenridge Long Franchere and Ross Cox
and make a general acknowledgment of aid received from these quarters
The work I here present to the public is necessarily of a rambling
and somewhat disjointed nature comprising various expeditions and
adventures by land and sea The facts however will prove to be linked
and banded together by one grand scheme devised and conducted by
a master spirit one set of characters also continues throughout
appearing occasionally though sometimes at long intervals and the
whole enterprise winds up by a regular catastrophe so that the work
without any labored attempt at artificial construction actually
possesses much of that unity so much sought after in works of fiction
and considered so important to the interest of every history

TWO leading objects of commercial gain have given birth to wide and
daring enterprise in the early history of the Americas the precious
metals of the South and the rich peltries of the North While the fiery
and magnificent Spaniard inflamed with the mania for gold has extended
his discoveries and conquests over those brilliant countries scorched by
the ardent sun of the tropics the adroit and buoyant Frenchman and the
cool and calculating Briton have pursued the less splendid but no
less lucrative traffic in furs amidst the hyperborean regions of the
Canadas until they have advanced even within the Arctic Circle
These two pursuits have thus in a manner been the pioneers and
precursors of civilization Without pausing on the borders they have
penetrated at once in defiance of difficulties and dangers to the
heart of savage countries laying open the hidden secrets of the
wilderness leading the way to remote regions of beauty and fertility
daller prendre a NewYork les depeches de France et apres avoir
mouille quelques jours en vue du port elle repartait alerte et
vive pour rallier lescadre et lui apporter les correspondances
attendues
Le temps etait superbe lhorizon tres pur quoique la brise fut
un peu forte lAtalante navait pas diminue de toile
Aussi filaitelle coquettement inclinee sur tribord et laissant
derriere elle un long sillage decume auquel les rayons du soleil
couchant imprimaient comme un reflet de pourpre
Presque tous les matelots etaient montes sur le pont et le
commandant luimeme venait de saccouder aux bastingages pour
embrasser dun dernier regard le vaste panorama de NewYork qui
allait tout a lheure sombrer et disparaitre dans les flots dor
de lhorizon
Cela dura une heure a peu pres au bout de laquelle les premieres
brumes du soir commencerent a flotter dans lair pendant que la
brise se mettait a mollir
LAtalante se redressa aussitot et ne tarda pas a reprendre
une allure plus calme
Le jeune lieutenant de vaisseau qui la commandait etait un des
officiers les plus distingue des ports de Brest et de Toulon En
peu dannees son intelligence son courage son sangfroid
avaient appele sur lui lattention de ses chefs et les vives
sympathies de ses camarades Il avait vingthuit ans a peine et
sappelait Gaston de Pradelle ses traits gardaient la vigoureuse
empreinte du hale de la mer mais lexpression un peu rude de sa
physionomie etait temperee par lextreme douceur de deux yeux
melancoliques et noirs
Pour ceux qui ne voyaient que la surface Gaston de Pradelle etait
le favori de la fortune partant le plus heureux des hommes
Mais pour les autres il y avait comme un inconnu chez ce grand
jeune homme souvent taciturne dont la levre segayait rarement
dun sourire et qui portait sur son front lombre de quelque amer
souvenir
Cependant Gaston de Pradelle etait descendu dans sa chambre et
apres avoir donne ses dernieres instructions a son second il
setait jete sur sa couchette et setait livre au sommeil
Combien dheures secoulerent des lors jusquau moment ou il se
reveilla  Il ne chercha meme pas a sen rendre compte
Tout ce quil se rappela plus tard cest quil fut brusquement
arrache au sommeil par un effroyable craquement qui sembla ouvrir
la pauvre goelette jusque dans ses oeuvres vives et quune
secousse suivit immediatement qui coucha lAtalante sur le
flanc a la faire chavirer
Que se passaitil

FANTASIES
Altruism A Legend of Old Persia
In the flowery land of Persia
Long ago as poets tell
Where three rivers met together
Did a happy people dwell
Never did these happy people
Suffer sickness plague or dearth
Living in a golden climate
In the fairest place on earth
Living thus thro endless summers
And halfsummers hardly colder
Growing tho they hardly guessed it
Very gradually older
I can very well imagine
These old Persian lords and ladies
Sitting in their pleasant gardens
Dreaming dozing where the shade is
Almond trees a mass of blossom
Roses roses red as wine
With the helmets of the tulips
Flaming in a martial line
While beside a marble basin
With a fountain gushing forth
Stands a redlegged crane alighted
From the deserts of the North
So they lived these ancient people
With the happy harmless faces
Dreaming till the purple twilight
In their flowery gardenplaces
Finding every year the sunshine
And the wind a little colder
Growing tho they hardly guessed it
Very gradually older
Till at last they grew so frail
That to their gardens they were carried
Very feeble and exhausted
Weak as babesBut still they tarried
Lying till the purple twilight
CHAPTER I
FIRST PRINCIPLES
We are often and rightly reminded that woman is half the human race It
is truer even than it appears Not only is woman half of the present
generation but present woman is half of all the generations of men and
women to come The argument of this book which will be regarded as
reactionary by many women called advancedpresumably as doctors say
that a case of consumption is advancedinvolves nothing other than
adequate recognition of the importance of woman in the most important of
all matters It is true that my primary concern has been to furnish for
the individual woman and for those in charge of girlhood a guide of
life based upon the known physiology of sex But it is a poor guide of
life which considers only the transient individual and poorest of all
in this very case
If it were true that woman is merely the vessel and custodian of the
future lives of men and women entrusted to her antenatal care by their
fathers as many creeds have supposed then indeed it would be a
question of relatively small moment how the mothers of the future were
chosen Our ingenious devices for ensuring the supremacy of man lend
colour to this idea We name children after their fathers and the fact
that they are also to some extent of the maternal stock is obscured
But when we ask to what extent they are also of maternal stock we find
that there is a rigorous equality between the sexes in this matter It
is a fact which has been ignored or inadequately recognized by every
feminist and by every eugenist from Plato until the present time
Salient qualities whether good or ill are more commonly displayed by
men than by women Great strength or physical courage or endurance
great ability or genius together with a variety of abnormalities are
much more commonly found in men than in women and the eugenic emphasis
has therefore always been laid upon the choice of fathers rather than of
mothers Not so long ago the scion of a noble race must marry not at
all necessarily the daughter of another noble race but rather any young
healthy woman who promised to be able to bear children easily and suckle
them long But directly we observe under the microscope the facts of
development we discover that each parent contributes an exactly equal
share to the making of the new individual and all the ancient and
modern ideas of the superior value of wellselected fatherhood fall to
the ground Woman is indeed half the race In virtue of expectant
motherhood and her antenatal nurture of us all she might well claim
to be more but she is half at least
And thus it matters for the future at least as much how the mothers are
chosen as how the fathers are This remains true notwithstanding that
the differences between men commending them for selection or rejection
seem so much more conspicuous and important than in the case of women
For in the first place the differences between women are much greater
than appear when for instance we read history as history is at present
understood or when we observe and compare the world and his wife
Uniformity or comparative uniformity of environment is a factor of
obvious importance in tending to repress the natural differences between
women Reverse the occupations and surroundings of the sexes and it
About ten years ago while spending a few days under the hospitable roof
of the distinguished Belgian jurist the lamented M de Laveleye our
conversation turned during one of our rambles to the subject of
religion Do you mean to say asked the venerable professor that you
have no religious instruction in your schools On my replying in the
negative he suddenly halted in astonishment and in a voice which I
shall not easily forget he repeated No religion How do you impart
moral education The question stunned me at the time I could give no
ready answer for the moral precepts I learned in my childhood days
were not given in schools and not until I began to analyze the
different elements that formed my notions of right and wrong did I find
that it was Bushido that breathed them into my nostrils
The direct inception of this little book is due to the frequent queries
put by my wife as to the reasons why such and such ideas and customs
prevail in Japan
In my attempts to give satisfactory replies to M de Laveleye and to my
wife I found that without understanding Feudalism and Bushido1 the
moral ideas of present Japan are a sealed volume
Footnote 1 Pronounced Boosheedoh In putting Japanese words and
names into English Hepburns rule is followed that the vowels should
be used as in European languages and the consonants as in English
Taking advantage of enforced idleness on account of long illness I put
down in the order now presented to the public some of the answers given
in our household conversation They consist mainly of what I was taught
and told in my youthful days when Feudalism was still in force
Between Lafcadio Hearn and Mrs Hugh Fraser on one side and Sir Ernest
Satow and Professor Chamberlain on the other it is indeed discouraging
to write anything Japanese in English The only advantage I have over
them is that I can assume the attitude of a personal defendant while
these distinguished writers are at best solicitors and attorneys I
have often thoughtHad I their gift of language I would present the
cause of Japan in more eloquent terms But one who speaks in a borrowed
tongue should be thankful if he can just make himself intelligible
All through the discourse I have tried to illustrate whatever points I
have made with parallel examples from European history and literature
believing that these will aid in bringing the subject nearer to the
comprehension of foreign readers
Should any of my allusions to religious subjects and to religious
workers be thought slighting I trust my attitude towards Christianity
itself will not be questioned It is with ecclesiastical methods and
with the forms which obscure the teachings of Christ and not with the
teachings themselves that I have little sympathy I believe in the
religion taught by Him and handed down to us in the New Testament as
well as in the law written in the heart Further I believe that God
hath made a testament which maybe called old with every people and
nationGentile or Jew Christian or Heathen As to the rest of my
theology I need not impose upon the patience of the public
In concluding this preface I wish to express my thanks to my friend
Anna C Hartshorne for many valuable suggestions and for the
characteristically Japanese design made by her for the cover of this
I like Rafael go the Christchurch she said I use go myself
homeItaly
The brown suit too small for Francie was just right for Rafael and
it would have been hard to find two happier little boys than Francie
and his fish when they walked into the Primary class together
Rafael clapped his hands with the rest when Miss Florence pinned the
fish in the river and the red tag on Francies blouse
Illustration Miss Florence pinned the fish in the river and the red
tag on Francies blouse
And what do you think Out in the big room there were two more new
fish one in Mother Fishers class and one in Father Fishers They
were Mr Lugi and the little Italian mother come to Sundayschool
with their little boy
Really and truly Francie said seems if I caught three fish
stead of one
Really and truly said Mother Fisher I think you did
ALL BY HERSELF
The older children were gone out for the day mamma was busy in the
sewing room with Miss Fay Molly was doing the Saturday baking What
could Alice do all by herself
This was the very question that popped into the wee girls own head
and she trotted off to ask mamma
Heres I she said at the sewing room door Heres I all by
myself Whats I goin do mamma
Going to be mammas good little daughter and amuse yourself this
morning without help from anybody See how busy I am
Everybodys busy that isnt gone way off said Alice dolefully
Well then said mamma Alice must be busy too taking care of
herself and making her own good times See how well she can do it
But first of all mamma went on think what you would like to do or
to have me get for you and Ill stop a minute now for that so as to
start you
This was an important thing to decide so Alice went into the next
room and sat down in her kindergarten chair before her table to think
it out She folded her arms and sat still about a minute then she ran
to mamma exclaiming I know now please get me my snub scissors of
course she meant roundpointed and some bright paper and Ill cut
and cut ever so long
Mamma dropped her work and got the things Now dear she said see
if you cant get along the rest of the morning by yourself Dolly and
the picture books are in the dining room Dont ask me for anything if
you can help it but keep out of mischief and be as happy as you can
Alice went back to her little table and soon had it covered with queer
things There were the oddest dolls you ever saw with arms sticking
out like stems and there were horses with as many legs as could be
put along the whole length of the body It was great fun to cut them
But by and by Alice grew tired of this and jumped up quickly Over
went the little table scattering things everywhere Such a litter
Ill just leave it all thought Alice Then a little voice inside
said Pick it all up and help mamma After a minute the little girl

execution of our undertaking we decided to invite the collaboration
of many scholars and specialists each of whom could out of the
fullness of information speak with authority on some particular
phase of the general subject We are glad to say that the eminent
writers to whom we addressed ourselves answered with promptitude and
alacrity to our call and have supplied us with such a body of
material as to enable us to bring out a book that is absolutely
unique
From each contributor we asked nothing but a plain verifiable
statement of facts and that we think is exactly what they have
given us for while we do not make ourselves personally responsible
for everything set down in the following pages we believe that what
stands written therein bears every mark of careful research and of
absolute reliability
Although on many of our subjects little more remains to be said than
what appears in the text yet the treatment on the whole does not
claim to be exhaustive and therefore each writer has at our
request appended to his contribution a short and carefully selected
bibliography so that those who are interested may have a guide for
further reading For our part we consider these lists of works of
reference to be a highly useful feature
It is a glorious thing for us who are proud one of us of his Irish
descent and the other of his Irish birth to think that the sons and
daughters of mother Erin have so conspicuously distinguished
themselves in such varied spheres of activity in every age and in so
many lands and that we were privileged to make public the record of
their achievements in a form never before attempted
We have other works in contemplation and some actually in
preparation which will go far to strengthen the claims put forward
in this book In the meantime we trust that the reception accorded
to it will be such as to encourage us to persevere in making still
better known the Glories of Ireland

However it was he instantly lost all fear when they met at the station
and Harte pressed forward with his cordial handclasp as if he were not
even a fairy prince and with that voice and laugh which were surely the
most winning in the world He was then as always a child of extreme
fashion as to his clothes and the cut of his beard which he wore in a
mustache and the drooping sidewhiskers of the day and his jovial
physiognomy was as winning as his voice with its straight nose and
fascinating thrust of the under lip its fine eyes and good forehead
then thickly crowned with the black hair which grew early white while
his mustache remained dark the most enviable and consoling effect
possible in the universal mortal necessity of either aging or dying He
was as one could not help seeing thickly pitted but after the first
glance one forgot this so that a lady who met him for the first time
could say to him Mr Harte arent you afraid to go about in the cars
so recklessly when there is this scare about smallpox No madam he
could answer in that rich note of his with an irony touched by
pseudopathos I bear a charmed life
The drive out from Boston was not too long for getting on terms of
personal friendship with the family which just filled the hack the two
boys intensely interested in the novelties of a New England city and
suburb and the father and mother continually exchanging admiration of
such aspects of nature as presented themselves in the leafless sidewalk
trees and patches of park and lawn They found everything so fine so
refined after the gigantic coarseness of California where the natural
forms were so vast that one could not get on companionable terms with
them Their host heard them without misgiving for the world of romance
which Harte had built up among those huge forms and with a subtle
perception that this was no excursion of theirs to the East but a
lifelong exodus from the exile which he presently understood they must
always have felt California to be It is different now when people are
every day being born in California and must begin to feel it home from
the first breath but it is notable that none of the Californians of that
great early day have gone back to live amid the scenes which inspired and
prospered them
Before they came in sight of the editors humble roof he had mocked
himself to his guest for his trepidations and Harte with burlesque
magnanimity had consented to be for that occasion only something less
formidable than he had loomed afar He accepted with joy the theory of
passing a week in the home of virtuous poverty and the week began as
delightfully as it went on From first to last Cambridge amused him as
much as it charmed him by that air of academic distinction which was
stranger to him even than the refined trees and grass It has already
been told how after a list of the local celebrities had been recited to
him he said why you couldnt stand on your front porch and fire off
your revolver without bringing down a two volumer and no doubt the
pleasure he had in it was the effect of its contrast with the wild
California he had known and perhaps when he had not altogether known
it had invented

INTRODUCTION
Among the stories of worldwide renown not the least stirring are
those that have gathered about the names of national heroes The
neid the Nibelungenlied the Chanson de Roland the Morte
DArthurthey are not history but they have been as National
Anthems to the races and their magic is not yet dead
In olden times our forefathers used to say that the world had seen
nine great heroes three heathen three Jewish and three
Christian among the Christian heroes was British Arthur and of
none is the fame greater Even to the present day his name
lingers in many widely distant places In the peninsula of Gower a
huge slab of rock propped up on eleven short pillars is still
called Arthurs Stone the lofty ridge which looks down upon
Edinburgh bears the name of Arthurs Seat andstrangest perhaps
of allin the Franciscan Church of faraway Innsbruck the finest
of the ten statues of ancestors guarding the tomb of the Emperor
Maximilian I is that of King Arthur There is hardly a country in
Europe without its tales of the WarriorKing and yet of any real
Arthur history tells us little and that little describes not the

I sometimes think theres never such Tirade
As where some Bridge Game has been badly Played
When Some One thinks you should have made no Trump
And you have thriftily declared a Spade
Illustration
Myself when Young did eagerly Frequent
Bridge Tournaments and heard Great Argument
About this Point and That Yet after all
Came out no Better Player than I went
Illustration
For I remember stopping by the Way
To watch Four Celebrated Champions play
They Differed on the Discard Make and Lead
Whatever One SaidSaid The Others Nay

Why if a Soul can fling the Rules aside
And let his CardSense be his Only Guide
Weret not a Shame weret not a Shame for him

And if the Card you hopefully Finesse
Capture the Trickyour Partner Smiles Oh yes
And you smile Broadly But if it be Caught
By the Fourth Handyour Smiles are somewhat Less

But if in Vain down on the Stubborn Score
You gaze and make it No Trumps just once more
With Strength in Every Suit but with No Ace
How thenwhen Dummy calmly Lays down Four

To Them the Heart Convention did I show
And with Mine Own Hand tried to make it go
But this is all the Wisdom that I reaped
With more than Three Hearts always lead the Low

For Trump or NoTrump though with all the Rules
Of different Masters and of different Schools
Ive played with Players of all Sortsbut I
Have never beaten anythingbut Fools

Indeed indeedto Quit It oft Before
I sworebut did I mean it when I swore
And thenand then came Three and Cards in Hand
I Joined them and they made me keep the Score

Alas how Subtle Bridge alluring Woos
And robs me of my Nightly BeautySnooze
I often Wonder what Bridge Players gain
Onehalf so Precious as the Sleep they Lose
I have not attempted to be profound or mystical or even scientific but
I have tried to present clearly simply and as nearly without bias as
possible an account of what I have seen and heard The weight of
evidence seems at the moment to be on the side of the biologists but
I am willing to reopen the case at any time although I am above all
a man of the open air of the plains and the mountains and do not
intend to identify myself with any branch of metapsychical research It
is probable therefore that this is my one and final contribution to
the study of the shadow world
HAMLIN GARLAND
CHICAGO July 1908
THE SHADOW WORLD
I
A hush fell over the dinnertable and every ear was open and inclined
as Cameron the host continued No I wouldnt say that There are
some things that are pretty well establishedtelepathy for instance
I dont believe even in telepathy asserted Mrs Quigg a very
positive journalist who sat at his right I think even that is mere
coincidence
Several voices rose in a chorus of protest Oh no Telepathy is real
Why Ive had experiences
There you go replied Mrs Quigg still in the heat of her opposition
You will all tell the same story Your friend was dying in Bombay or
Vienna and his spirit appeared to you a la Journal of Psychic
Research with a message at the exact hour computing difference in
time which no one ever does and so on I know that kind of thingbut
that isnt telepathy
What is telepathy then asked little Miss Brush who paints
miniatures
I cant describe a thing that doesnt exist replied Mrs Quigg The
word means feeling at a distance does it not professor
Harris a teacher of English who seldom took a serious view of
anything answered I should call it a longdistance touch
Do you believe in hypnotism Dr Miller asked Miss Brush quietly
addressing her neighbor a young scientist whose specialty was
chemistry
No replied he I dont believe in a single one of these supernatural
forces
You mean you dont believe in anything you have not seen yourself
said I
To this Miller slowly replied I believe in Vienna which I have never
seen but I dont believe in a Vienna doctor who claims to be able to
hypnotize a man so that he can smile while his leg is being taken off
Oh thats a fact stated Brierly the portraitpainter that happens
every day in our hospitals here in New York City
Have you ever seen it done asked Miller bristling with opposition
No
Well asserted Miller I wouldnt believe it even if I saw the
operation performed
You dont believe in any mystery unless it is familiar said I
One major point of confusion should be mentioned In the
section on the Seven Wonders of the World what is usually
described as the Lighthouse of Pharos appears to have been
merged with the socalled Egyptian Labyrinth described by
Herodotussee the title and the description in the text In
the next section the Pyramids of Egypt there is a reference
to a black marble head on the third pyramidperhaps this
represents some confusion with the Sphynx

THE SCIENCE OF FAIRY TALES
CHAPTER I
THE ART OF STORYTELLING
The art of storytellingUnity of human imaginationDefinition
of Fairy TalesVariable value of TraditionStorytelling and
the storyteller among various peoplesThe connection of
folktales with folksongsContinuity of TraditionNeed of
accuracy and good faith in reporting stories
The art of storytelling has been cultivated in all ages and among all
nations of which we have any record it is the outcome of an instinct
implanted universally in the human mind By means of a story the savage
philosopher accounts for his own existence and that of all the phenomena
which surround him With a story the mothers of the wildest tribes awe
their little ones into silence or rouse them into delight And the
weary hunters beguile the long silence of a desert night with the mirth
and wonders of a tale The imagination is not less fruitful in the
higher races and passing through forms sometimes more sometimes less

THE LAIRD OF GLENCARDINE
Why whats the matter child Tell me
Nothing dadreally nothing
Dont know as I ever saw a finer observed Daniel Off on a cruise
somewhere I presume likely hey
Picnic down at the Point
Well youve got picnic weather all right Yes sir you have
Comment concerning the weather is the inevitable preliminary to all
commercial transactions in Trumet Now preliminaries being over Daniel
waited hopefully for what was to follow His hopes were dashed
Isis Miss Dott about inquired one of the callers
Miss Dott Oh Gertie No she aint Shes gone down street
somewheres Be back pretty soon I shouldnt wonder
Humph Well Im afraid we cant wait We hoped she might go with us on
the picnic Weerwe wanted her very much
That so Im sorry but Im afraid she couldnt go even if she was
here You see its her last day at home andweher mother and
Ithat is I dont believe shed want to leave us today
No no of course not Well tell her we wish she might have come
but we understand Yes yes in answer to the calls from the barge
were coming Well good by Captain Dott
Ergood by Ererdont want anything to take along do you A nice
box of candy oror anything
No I think not We stopped at the Emporium just now and loaded up
with candy enough to last a week Good morning
How are you fixed for sun hats and things Ive got a nice line of hats
andwell good by
Good by
The barge moved off Daniel standing dejectedly in the door
remembered his manners
Hope you have a nice time he shouted Then he turned and moved
disconsolately back to the desk He might have expected it It was thus
in nine cases out of ten The Emporium Mr J Cohen proprietor was
his undoing in this instance as in so many others The Emporium got the
trade and he got the good bys Mr Cohen was not an old resident as
he was Mr Cohens daughter was not invited to picnics by the summer
people Mrs Cohen was not head of the sewing circle and the Chapter of
the Ladies of Honor and prominent socially as was Mrs Dott but Mr
Cohen bought cheap and sold cheap and the Emporium flourished like a
green bay tree while the Metropolitan Store was rapidly going to seed
Daniel looking out through the front window at the blue sea in the
distance thought of the past of the days when as commander and
part owner of the three masted schooner Bluebird he had been free and
prosperous and happy Then he considered the future which was bluer
than the sea and sighed again Why had he not been content to stick
to the profession he understood to remain on the salt water he loved
instead of retiring from the sea to live on dry land and squander his
small fortune in a business for which he was entirely unfitted
And yet the answer was simple enough Mrs DottMrs Serena Dott his
wifewas the answer she and her social aspirations It was Serena
who had coaxed him into giving up seafaring who had said that it was
a shame for him to waste his life ordering foremast hands about when he
might be one of the leading citizens in his native town It was Serena
gathered in front of the palace rather than before the Chamber of
Deputies
You forget that the premier is closeted with the king returned Hal
In all probability the first word of a definite step will emanate from
the palace though unofficially of course
I see said Chester Welllook there Hal
Whats the matter demanded the latter eying his companion in
some surprise
Chester seized his friends arm with one hand and with the other pointed
directly ahead Hal gazed in the direction indicated He saw at once what
had caused Chesters sudden exclamation
Not five yards away right in the center of the dense crowd but still in
view of the two boys stood an Italian army officer in full uniform He
was gazing straight ahead toward the palace steps paying no heed to
those who pushed and jostled him He stood erect with arms folded upon
his breast
Even as the two boys looked an arm came from behind him and reaching
across his shoulder a hand crept cautiously into the pocket of the
officers military cloak which he had thrown open because of its warmth
Hal uttered a low exclamation and was about to step forward when there
came a sudden shout from the crowd which surged in about him cutting
off his view of the Italian officer For a single instant Hal turned his
eyes toward the palace and there took one look at a second uniformed
figure who stood upon the top step and waved his arms about violently
I guess war has come the boy muttered to himself as he took a step
forward and elbowed his way toward the spot where the other Italian
officer stood
Chester came close behind his friend
By dint of hard pushing and shoving which drew ugly remarks from some of
the bystanders upon whose feet they trod the boys at last came to the
spot they sought They had made good time and the invisible owner of the
hand that had explored the officers pocket was just withdrawing it And
in it Hal saw a white paper flutter
He uttered a cry and dashed forward in spite of the crowd At almost the
same moment the officer came to life Instinct must have warned him that
there was something wrong He clapped his hand to his pocket and then
uttered a fierce ejaculation in his native tongue
He wheeled about with a cry and his arm shot out There was a struggle
and then the officer fell to the ground A blow from his adversarys fist
had laid him low Hal who was a few leaps ahead of Chester reached out
to seize the man who he could see still held the bit of white paper in
his hand but the other was too quick for him
With a sudden backward leap he was among the crowd which apparently
had failed to grasp the significance of the trouble Hal uttered a quick
cry to Chester and also dashed into the crowd Chester followed him
Ahead but almost hidden by others of the crowd which pressed forward
the better to see what was going on upon the palace steps Hal could see
his quarry squirming his way through the dense mass of humanity
Stop him he cried raising his voice to a shout
The crowd paid no heed The people were too wrapped up in what was going

tralies door niets dan een smal grachtje van het blanke wonder het
dogenpaleis gescheidenklonk de lach der meisjes helder op bij een
kwinkslag van den cipier die rinkelend met een groote sleutelbos de
gevangenis voor een oud vrouwtje opensloot
Deze gevangenis op de zonnige kade vol cafes en hotels midden in t
gewoel van vroolijkpratende en druk gesticuleerende menschen die zich
geen oogenblik de nabijheid van dit donkerdreigende bewust schenen en
er luchthartig en schertsend aan voorbij slenterden Elizabeth had
er nooit aan kunnen wennen En toen ze nu zelf de marmeren trap was
opgegaan keek ze stilstaand op t platform naar t smalle zwarte
grachtje waarboven blank de beruchte brug der zuchten afstak de Ponto
dei Sospiri die de gerechtszaal van het paleis met de gevangenis met de
looden daken verbindt moeilijken weg dien ook Casanova eenmaal is
gegaan toen hij er zijn straf uitzat Maar nu zij zich omkeerde zag zij
weg van dit donkere het licht in over het als satijn glanzend
smaragdblauwe water met de vele vele gondels En opnieuw genoot zij
bewust de weelde van t ontbreken van alle modern vervoerrumoer Hier
geen autosignalen of knallende motorfietsen zelfs geen kargeratel
alleen t geplas der gondelriemen waarmee de roeier staande het
sierlijk vaartuig voortbeweegt
Een wondermooi ding vond ze een gondel nee meer dan een ding een
levend wezen vol bevallige zwenkingen En altijd weer zag ze er iets
anders in een omgekruld boomblad of een donkere drijvende bloem dan
weer een zwarte zwaan met gebogen nek een zilveren gekartelde keten om
den ranken hals
Lang bleef Elizabeth uitstaren over het nu weer onwezenlijk violet
gekleurd water waaruit aan den overkant de Maria della Salute scheen op
te rijzen de omtrekken sterk afgeteekend tegen diepblauwe lucht en
heel in de verte aan paarlmoeren horizont blauwschemerend Lido
Het was om niet van weg te komen maar er wachtte zooveel En toen ze
nu langzaam de lage breede brugtreden afdaalde trachtte ze bijna
onbewust iets over te nemen van de houding der even tevoren bewonderde
Italiaansche vrouwen al besefte ze wel dat de gratie en het koninklijk
gebaar hier den armste aangeboren niet is na te apen en er veel van
wat hier volkomen natuurlijk aandoet en aan dit volk bekoort in Holland
dwaastheatraal zou schijnen
Op de Piazzetta gekomen ging ze er zitten met het gezicht naar den
voorgevel van het Dogenpaleis blank en glanzend de portiek van korte
krachtige zuilen steunend de sierlijke loggia versierd met
marmerkantwerkhet opene in den vorm van een klaverbladen daarboven
de derde verdieping met de zeven spitsboogvensters in beide facaden
van een zalmrose kleur zooals het hart van kleine zeeschelpen
Altijd weer kwam ze hier terug en zat maar stil op te zien naar dit
wonder van gothiek en werd er nooit van verzadigd Dit was haar
dierbaarder nog dan de San Marco Hoezeer ze ook binnen in de kerk
genoot van het koloriet van mozaiken en marmersoorten van de pracht
der schilderingen en kleurenmengeling toch miste ze er in de
overlading en bijeengebrachte praal de mystiek der groote cathedralen
En zij herinnerde zich hoe de Franschsprekende gids die haar in Florence
had rondgeleid in de Santa Maria Annunziata vertelde dat juist om die
generously wafted inland to Quillcote
Mrs Wiggin is thoroughly in love with this big rambling house from
garret to cellar  A genuine historic air seems to surround the entire
place lending an added charm and there are many impressive
characteristics of the house in its dignity of architecture which seem
to speak of a past century with volumes of history in reserve  A few
steps from these ample grounds on the opposite side of the road is a
pretty wooden cottage of moderate size and very attractive the early
home of Mrs Wiggin  These scenes have inspired much of the local
coloring of her stories of New England life and character  Pleasant
River in Timothys Quest is drawn from this locality and in her
latest book The Village Watch Tower many of her settings and
descriptions are very close to existing conditions
Her own room and literary workshop is on the second floor of the house
it is distinctively a study in white and no place could be more ideal
for creative work  It has the cheeriest outlook from four windows with
a southern exposure overlooking a broad grass plat studded with trees
where birds from early dawn hold merry carnival and squirrels find
perfect and unmolested freedom  A peep into this sanctum is a most
convincing proof that she is a woman who dearly loves order as every
detail plainly indicates and it is also noticeable that any display of
literary litter is most conspicuously absent
Interesting souvenirs and gifts of infinite variety are scattered all
over the room on the wainscoting mantel and in every available
niche very many are from children and all are dainty tributes  A
picture of an irresistibly droll child face of the African type and
infectiously full of mirth is one of a great company of children who
look at you from every side and angle of the room
Dainty old pieces of china rare bits of bricabrac the very broad
and oldtime fireplaces filled with cut boughs of the spicy fir balsam
and various antique pieces of furniture lend to the inner atmosphere of
Quillcote a fine artistic and colonial effect while not a stones
throw away at the foot of a precipitous bank flowsin a very
irregular channelthe picturesque Saco River
In this summer home Mrs Wiggin has the companionship of her mother
and her sister Miss Nora Smith herself a writer which renders it
easy to abandon herself wholly to her creative work this coupled with
the fact that she is practically in seclusion banishes even a thought
of interruption
And now what was the beginning and the growth of the delightful
literary faculty which has already given birth to so many pleasant
fancies and happy studies especially of young life  A glimpse is
given in the following playful letter and postscript from herself and
her sister to a wouldbe biographer
MY DEAR BOSWELLI have asked my family for some incidents of my
childhood as you bade mesoliciting any anecdotes
characteristics or early tendencies that may have been as you
suggest foreshadowings of later things
I have been much chagrined at the result  My younger sister states
that I was a nice wellmannered capable child nothing more and that
the earth the elect of society represented by that little great world
which lies between the narrow circle bounded by Bryanstone Square on the
north and by Birdcage Walk on the south did not consider seven oclock
too early an hour for a dinner party which was to be followed by routs
drums concerts conversazione as the case might be It was seven
oclock on a lovely June evening and the Park was already deserted and
carriages were rolling swiftly along all the Westend squares carrying
rank fashion wealth and beauty political influence and intellectual
power to the particular circle in which each was destined to illumine
upon that particular evening
Stateliest among London squares Grosvenorin some wise a wonder to the
universe as newly lighted with gasgrave Grosvenor with its heavy old
Georgian houses and pompous porticoes sparkled and shone not alone
with the novel splendour of gas but with the light of many wax candles
clustering flowerlike in silver branches and girandoles multiplying
their flame in numerous mirrors and of all the houses in that stately
square none had a more imposing aspect than Lord Denyers dark red brick
mansion with stone dressings and the massive grandeur of an Egyptian
mausoleum
Lord Denyer was an important personage in the political and diplomatic
world He had been ambassador at Constantinople and at Paris and had
now retired on his laurels an influence still but no longer an active
power in the machine of government At his house gathered all that was
most brilliant in London society To be seen at Lady Denyers evening
parties was the guinea stamp of social distinction to dine with Lord
Denyer was an opening in life almost as valuable as University honours
and more difficult of attainment
It was during the quarter of an hour before dinner that a group of
persons mostly personages congregated round Lord Denyers
chimneypiece naturally trending towards the social hearth albeit it
was the season for roses and lilies rather than of fires and the hum of
the city was floating in upon the breath of the warm June evening
through the five tall windows which opened upon Lord Denyers balcony
The ten or twelve persons assembled seemed only a sprinkling in the large
lofty room furnished sparsely with amber satin sofas a pair of Florentine
marble tables and half an acre or so of looking glass Voluminous amber
draperies shrouded the windows and deadened the sound of rolling wheels
and the voices and footfalls of western London The drawing rooms of those
days were neither artistic nor picturesqueneither Early English nor Low
Dutch nor Renaissance nor AngloJapanese A stately commonplace
distinguished the reception rooms of the great world Upholstery stagnated
at a dead level of fluted legs gilding plate glass and amber satin
Lady Denyer stood a little way in advance of the group on the hearthrug
fanning herself with her eye on the door while she listened languidly
to the remarks of a youthful diplomatist a sprig of a lordly tree upon
the last debut at Her Majestys Theatre
My own idea was that she screamed said her ladyship But the new
Rosinas generally do scream Why do we have a new Rosina every year
whom nobody ever hears of afterwards What becomes of them Do they die
or do they set up as singing mistresses in secondrate wateringplaces

INTRODUCTION
The Red True Story Book needs no long Introduction The Editor in
presenting The Blue True Story Book apologised for offering tales so
much less thrilling and romantic than the legends of the Fairies but he
added that even real facts were sometimes curious and interesting
Next year he promises something quite as true as History and quite as
entertaining as Fairies
For this book Mr Rider Haggard has kindly prepared a narrative of
Wilsons Last Fight by aid of conversations with Mr Burnham the
gallant American scout But Mr Haggard found while writing his
chapter that Mr Burnham had already told the story in an Interview
published by the Westminster Gazette The courtesy of the proprietor
of that journal and of Mr Burnham has permitted Mr Haggard to
incorporate the already printed narrative with his own matter
The Life and Death of Joan the Maid is by the Editor who has used M
Quicherats Proces five volumes published for the Historical Society
